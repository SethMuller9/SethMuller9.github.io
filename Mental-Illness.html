      <p><strong>Yes, mental illness is real.</strong> We can observe it in brain scans, biomarkers, and self-report. But our categories aren’t as airtight as we imagine.</p>

      <p>In 1973, psychologist David Rosenhan ran the now-famous <em>“On Being Sane in Insane Places”</em> experiment. Healthy volunteers walked into psychiatric hospitals claiming they heard vague voices but otherwise behaved normally. Every single one was admitted, diagnosed, and in some cases held for weeks — their ordinary behaviors were interpreted as symptoms. After publication, hospitals challenged Rosenhan to send more impostors, and staff eagerly flagged dozens of supposed fakes — except Rosenhan hadn’t sent anyone at all.</p>

      <p><strong>The takeaway?</strong> Our diagnostic boxes are sometimes useful for advancing treatment, but they can also distort, stigmatize, and even erase the human being behind the label. And this isn’t just about hospitals in the ’70s — even today, the way we think about mental illness shapes how people approach therapy, often creating barriers.</p>

      <p>There are many misconceptions. Some believe talking to a friend is the same as therapy. Others see therapy as something for the weak. Or they assume it’s only for people with “serious” mental illness.</p>

      <p><strong>In fact, therapy is for anyone who wants to grow.</strong></p>

      <p>The human brain, for its part, is incredibly adaptive. It deploys anxiety, denial, dissociation, or even aggression — not necessarily because you’re “sick,” but because your nervous system is doing its best to keep you alive in unbearable circumstances. Survival mechanisms aren’t always pathways to happiness, though. That’s where therapy comes in.</p>

      <p>Therapy isn’t about weakness. It’s about building strengths. Sometimes solving problems doesn’t mean tackling them head-on, but learning to play the cards you already have: creativity, flexibility, resilience, humor, or compassion. A good therapist helps you discover those strengths, expand them, and use them to create a life worth living. We can only talk about our problems so much — real change happens when we fortify strengths and experience the presence of an attuned other. That’s when organic solutions begin to arise.</p>

      <p><strong>So no — therapy isn’t “just talking to a friend.”</strong> Friends can be wonderfully therapeutic, but therapy offers a different kind of relationship: one built on training, attunement, and intentional growth. And therapy isn’t about weakness — it’s about the courage to grow stronger.</p>
